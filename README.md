# Luna Homepage - Homework #1

## Description 

This is my first foray into HTML and CSS coding and I thought it would be fun to make a few pages about our new dog, Luna.
This will be something fun I can share with friends as I can update the Portfolio page as she gets older with videos and pictures of funny things she does.
It is a work in progress so it will get better as time goes on.
